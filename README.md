# Screeps Repo

![](https://screeps.com/images/logotype-animated.svg)

## This is my repo for my logic in the game screeps.


## Technologies

I'm using Typescript to write my current logic, with Webassembly via Rust or Assemblyscript to be used if I need the performance 

## Usage example

Downloade the repo, install all the NPM dependencies and run 

```
npm run build
``` 

To package into a single .js file.

Alternatively manually run:

```
tsc
```
To build the typescript files into individual .js files and then run

```
webpack
```
To package the individual .js files up into one.
